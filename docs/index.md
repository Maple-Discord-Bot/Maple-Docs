## How do I understand this?

!!! tip
    - When You see `<>` around something, it means the thing is required example `.ban <member>` 
    - When You see `[]` around something, it means the thing is optional example `.bal [member]` 
    - When You see `|` within something, it means the thing is an aliases for the command example `.bal|balance <member>` here you can use either bal or balance 

!!! danger
    Do NOT type out `<>` or `[]` or `|` etc
